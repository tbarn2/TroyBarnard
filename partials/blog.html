    <p><b>Reading:</b> How Adidas Is Helping Get Racism Out Of School Sports - ALEXANDRA ILYASHOV<br>
        <b>Link: </b><a href="http://www.refinery29.com/2015/11/97139/adidas-high-school-sports-uniform-designs"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> Source</a><br><br>
        Sportswear company Adidas is trying to facilitate the movement away from racist high-school sports mascots by replacing logos and helping pay for the branding changes. This movement seems to be a direct response to the NFL’s Washington Redskins’ reluctance to change their logo or name. The Redskins logo depicts an image of a Native American warrior, many consider this a racist logo when presented along with the name “redskin”.<br><br>
        It is very important to consider your branding in a design process and whom it may possibly offend. Although logos like the Washington Redskins’ logo were created in a different time, way before the current era of political correctness. There has been a lot of push back against the Redskins for their name and logo even so much that broadcast commentators will be fined if they use the name “Redskins” and must refer to them as simply “Washington”.<br><br>
        It is a very important part that Addidas is playing here because they are making it easier for schools to rebrand. It’s really a win-win scenario for Addidas and the schools taking advantage of this opportunity because they can eliminate racism and replace old uniforms all in one fell swoop.<br><br>
        While a lot of schools are following suit and removing racism from their athletic program branding there are still some reluctant parties. The University of North Dakota recently completed a very long rebranding process. It was initially decided by the NCAA that they had to change their name from the Fighting Sioux deeming it a racist reference to the Sioux tribe. While the teams at North Dakota are now officially the “Fighting Hawks”, die hard fans and alumni still refer to the teams as the “Fighting Sioux”.<br><br>
        I personally don’t see a well enough formed argument from parties like North Dakota and Washington. In the case of Washington they have a blatantly racist name and refuse to change.  While a name change may hurt your nostalgia the current name is offensive to a large group of Americans and it’s hurting Washington and the NFL’s business. I don’t believe too many Native Americans find it easy to root for a team like the Redskins. A rebrand can also be beneficial as new jerseys often drive sales as diehard fans want to have up to date gear.<br><br>
        A counter argument often used by teams that don’t want to change is that a team like the NHL’s Chicago Blackhawks seems to evade scrutiny. While the Blackhawk’s logo depicts a Native American warrior the name itself is a reference to a US Military regiment by the same name, which included many Native Americans. This name also has full support from the original Blackhawks.<br><br>
        From a design standpoint I find it very critical that logos and names remove themselves from all association with race. Even if you personally do not see the association some others may and you have to anticipate that. Any alienating because of your branding will hurt your overall product and must be avoided at all costs.<br><br>

    <p><b>Reading:</b> Vanessa Cho on GoPro’s design approach - Mary Tressler<br>
        <b>Link: </b><a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/11/vanessa-cho-on-gopros-design-approach.html"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> Source</a><br><br>
        On the latest O’Riely design podcast Mary Tressler spoke with Vanessa Cho the head of UX and for the software services at Go-Pro. Cho got into contrasting software and hardware. Both hardware and software have to be rock solid on release for sale however there is more leeway however on software. Software can be updated after release and major issues can be solved by a simple update on the app store. Hardware however is a different story; once you release flawed hardware you can’t fix it with an app update it will just be flawed forever. For this reason hardware has to have more attention in the design process and needs to be a priority. If you have to make a decision in your design process whether to focus more on your hardware or software you just have to choose software.<br><br>
        Go-Pro is growing its design team for this exact reason. They’ve grown to 18 designers in 18 months Cho being the first of those. While Go-Pro products do involve some software they are primarily a hardware company. When Go-Pro releases a new camera it has to be absolutely certain that the product has minimal design issues when it comes to hardware. While you should never cut corners in design, reality does take its toll and focus must be pushed towards hardware.<br><br>
        Cho attributes a lot of their success to design process. By going through an intense recruiting process Go-Pro hires some of the best designers in the world. This ensures that Go-Pro employees are surrounded by young and fresh talent. A group of highly involved peers ensures that they are always innovating and working hard to come up with progressive designs for their products.<br><br>
        I haven’t spent too much time designing any hardware but this article really opened my eyes to how important it is that you must be confident in your product from a hardware standpoint upon release. A lot of times when I update my website I think “Oh yeah I’ll fix these problems and then later I can go back and fix any issues that arise from those changes”. This cannot be the mentality in hardware you can’t release untested hardware.
        In the future I will try to use a harder approach to my work after seeing how hard designers who work with hardware work. If all software developers work with the mentality that things must be perfect upon release there will be more quality products out there.<br><br>
        One thing I think we overlook as iSchool students is hardware. A lot of our coursework is on programming languages and design processes; we never really get deep into making a physical product. I feel like this is an important skill when looking for a career in design and it is hard to judge a good starting point. You can’t just make your own iPhone, you can try but the labor is very intense. After hearing what Cho has to say I have a new found appreciation for hardware design and I hope I can spread that to my colleagues.

    <p><b>Reading:</b> How to design apps children love - Neil Bennett<br>
        <b>Link: </b><a href="http://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/features/interactive-design/how-design-apps-children-love/"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> Source</a><br><br>
        It is an interesting predicament, designing apps for children. Jane Murison, BBC’s head of User Experience states that it all comes down to keeping kids entertained and updating the app so they don’t lose interest. Every second in-app that a child spends and is not playing your game is a second they can quit out of boredom. One way Jane Murison combats this issue is by making dead-air features like loading screens feel like part of the game. For instance instead of your run of the mill boring loading screen you might go for the approach of making the loading screen look like a pop-out book. This way the children are still engaged and not waiting for their entertainment experience to continue. If a child’s entertainment experience doesn’t have any lapses then they have fewer opportunities to quit out of your app due to boredom. A constant non-stop experience keeps users engaged.
        <br>
        <br>
        Jane also elaborated on how she designs for age groups and that there is no right age for an app. All children are different and will enter your experience with varied levels of reading, righting, and other cognitive skills independent of their ages. You can’t anticipate that every 4 year old will have the same intelligence as their lives will be drastically different especially in ages before schooling begins. For this reason setting an audience to an app based on age is inherently flawed.
        <br>
        <br>
        I’m fairly interested in app development so this article really engaged me. I don’t particularly see myself designing apps for children but I’m not limiting myself. Apps for children seem more difficult because you have to make fewer assumptions about intelligence. You can’t assume every child who uses your app will have the same vocabulary so that may limit what words you can use in your app. Same goes for math skills and puzzle solving. If your app features puzzles that are too difficult for some children to solve, you run the risk of kids getting frustrated and quitting your app. On the other hand though there is most likely a group of children who enjoy challenging puzzles and want to be pushed by your experience to learn more and more.
        Personally I feel if you are designing for all children you have to focus a little bit more on the lower end of the spectrum. You can not alienate users by belittling their intelligence. It’s a bigger risk to make a kid feel like they’re not smart enough for an app than kids feeling like the app is easy and they’re too smart for it. If more kids have the positive experience of it being too easy than that is less being told they’re not good enough. Now some challenge will be necessary to learn but you have to know your audience. Asking a toddler to solve a multiplication table probably isn’t going to yield a very good user experience. You have to be aware of your user’s intellectual scope and design your app to embrace that.

    <p><b>Reading:</b> Irvine mayor's "In God We Trust" design idea falls flat - Sarah de Crescenzo<br>
        <b>Link: </b><a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/council-691560-phrase-display.html"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> Source</a><br><br>
        Mayor Steven Choi of Irvine, California has been met with backlash on his plan to put the words "In God We Trust" on the wall of the council chambers. Critiques of his idea state that the design itself is too big and expensive. Another judgment is that having such holy words in a civic center flies in the face of the separation of the church and the state.<br><br>
        Personally I don't see the reason why such an addition is necessary. If the mayor wants those words around him he can put them up in his own home. Mayor Choi doesn't own the council chambers; they are not his to decorate.<br><br>
        Honestly it doesn't seem as if any members of his council even support this, stating the $3,200 price point is too expensive or that they might be alienating the non-secular community members that they serve. Either way you look at it going through with this design is not a good idea. It just seems like a selfish act by Mayor Choi to use public funding to impose his beliefs.<br>

    <p><b>Reading:</b> Either way, the new Starbucks cup is just a good design - By: Stephanie Buck<br>
        <b>Link: </b><a href="http://mashable.com/2015/11/11/starbucks-cup-design"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> Source</a><br><br>
        The latest outrage to smother the Internet is over Starbucks' new holiday coffee cups. Starbucks decided to follow a fashionable design trend and go with a minimalistic cup this year. Many people took offense to this claiming they were going overboard with political correctness by not having any references to Christmas on the new cup.<br><br>
        I for one think this outrage is utterly ridiculous. To me, whether my coffee cup tells me Merry Christmas or not has no effect on me. I'm going to have a Merry Christmas whether it likes it or not.<br><br>
        In Buck's attached article she goes deeper into the though process of the design and why it's just a good simple design. A lot of designs are trending towards a minimalistic vibe and you have to admit it looks pretty good.<br><br>
        The part where I don't side with Starbucks is when they stated that the cup is blank red so customers could "project their own holiday stories onto it". I'm sorry I don't stare at a Starbucks coffee cup and have flashbacks of childhood Christmases. This explanation seems very lackluster and Starbucks should just stick with the minimalistic story.</p>

        <br><br>
        Students at Eindhoven Design Academy are now focusing on relevant real world design problems rather than small theoretical problems. The students came together and decided they could do a lot of work to help the European refugee crisis.<br><br>
        One proposed design solution was a small portable embassy for stateless refugees. This could be a very great idea if pulled off well. One huge problem with a large mass of refugees is that they're not organized. When given a medium to share ideas and thoughts order could be restored to many individuals who've gone without order for so long. This idea also had a crow sourcing idea; to let refugees come in and suggest ways they could help and fit into their new societies.<br><br>
        The other main project brought up in this article was transferable passports, as in you can basically trade citizenship with other individuals. I personally don't see how this would help refugees. It makes no sense why someone with a perfectly good citizenship would give it up to somebody else no matter how altruistic they are. While I question the use of this idea it does present an entirely new way to perceive the concept of citizenship. Never before has where someone belongs to been seen as something that could be traded or borrowed.

    <p><b>Reading:</b> Airbnb's design approach - By: Mary Treseler <br><b>Link: </b><a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/10/airbnbs-design-approach.html"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> Source</a>
        <br><br>
        When enlightening on how the design process at airbnb works Katie Dill describes it as a "tri-force" of three key guidelines; being a host, simplifying, and every frame matters. The first guideline is very important on multiple levels for airbnb, a service that provides unique alternative temporary housing. The design of airbnb must be very welcoming since the website itself is a medium in which hosts and guests both interact. This means airbnb is serving two different types of users who each have unique interests. One point Dill made was that when hiring new staff she looks for people who have humility because the product they're putting together is not for themselves it is for the users.<br><br>
        The second guideline in Dill's tri-force analogy is simplifying. To me this really was eye opening. You can't just design something that is easy for yourself to navigate, you must factor in your users experience. It's usually fairly easy navigate something you created because you were present throughout every iteration of the design but first time users will have much less of a head start. You can't leave your users behind, design around them to make your interface friendly and welcoming. You never want to confuse your user base.<br><br>
        Every frame matters is the last argument Dill makes. This means that there's no cutting of corners. Every single element of airbnb's website could give a person to either love it or hate it. Something as simple as clashing background and text colors could cause someone to have a bad user experience. Saying something is just good enough is so easy to do but its negative impact on your work can be much more detrimental than the short feeling of relief you receive for finishing something.<br>

    <p> <b>Reading:</b> New Microsoft Band adds a barometer and a curved design - By: Mark Langshaw<br>
        <b>Link: </b><a href="http://www.digitalspy.com/tech/news/a672277/new-microsoft-band-adds-a-barometer-and-a-curved-design.html#~pqXZWZUTdvbEXH"><i class="fa fa-external-link"></i> Source</a><br><br>

        Microsoft has come out with their new design for their health wristband known as the Microsoft Band and it will be available on October 30th. It seems like the biggest change to this design is that it is curved all the way around the wristband. This was not the case with Microsoft's first iteration of Band as its previous design had a flat screen and then a hemi-circle band attached on either end of the screen. Presumably this design will be far more comfortable no matter where you wear it on your wrist. The previous design's flat screen made it uncomfortable to place the screen side on the top of the wrist and the only place it really felt comfortable was on the underside of the wrist. Microsoft seems confidant in the software involved with Band as they have not made any drastic changes to Band other than the curvature.
        <br><br>The only other new part about the Band is that it will have a barometer sensor to provide users with altitude information. This feels like a very niche addition, as barometers are not necessary for displaying health information, the main purpose of the Band. While I myself am not interested in purchasing a Microsoft Band I could see how the product is an attractive smart band option for those interested in outdoorsy activities such as hiking and rock climbing.<br>
        <br>
